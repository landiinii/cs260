      Landiinii is awesome! Bottom line. If you look through his portfolio you will see that he takes gorgeous, unique, authentic photos. What you won't see looking at his portfolio is his personable-ness behind the scenes. What I love most about working with Landiinii for my mirror selfies was that he captured my passion and personality through a camera, and through a mirror. He  encourages you to be yourself and wants to capture you for who you are, not what he thinks will look best. If you spend time talking to Landiinii you can hear how passionate he is about his work. If you are looking for the best, I give Landiinii my highest recommendation

    By far one of the most talented guys with a camera youll ever meet! He will go out of his way to get to know you and make your sessions one of a kind. 11/10 would recommend Landiinii for all your photographer needs but especially for Mirror selfies, this dude is awesome.

    Who knew that there was such a great photographer in Provo? I suspected that Landiinii was going to be really really really good. He was even better than that! The experience was great! Landiinii was excellent at making it comfortable. And I got some really awesome pictures that my wife loves. Seriously good stuff that definitely enhances my professional image< and all just in front of a Mirror! Landiinii knew exactly what I needed, even when I wasn't sure!
